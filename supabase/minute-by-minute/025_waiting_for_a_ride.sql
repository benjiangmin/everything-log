-- Minute by Minute: waiting for the bus isn't a stop, even a long wait. Run after 024, in the
-- minute-by-minute project. Safe to run again. (Replaces 024's 8-minute rule.)
--
-- 024 only left out stops under 8 minutes, but you sometimes wait 15+. Now a stop somewhere that
-- isn't one of your places, followed straight away by a ride (bus or car speeds), is waiting
-- (up to 45 minutes) and joins the Commute. Very short stops (under 8 minutes) still do too.
-- Your phone's next sync applies it to the last 24 hours.

-- The phone's sync (same as 024, plus: waiting for a ride isn't a stop, however long, up to 45 minutes).
