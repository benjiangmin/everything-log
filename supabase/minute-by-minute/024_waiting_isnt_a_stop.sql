-- Minute by Minute: waiting isn't a stop. Run after 023, in the minute-by-minute project. Safe

-- A short stop (under 8 minutes) somewhere that isn't one of your places, like waiting at the bus
-- stop outside the SAC, was being drawn as a visit to the nearest place (the SAC) and split your
-- commute in two. Now it's left out, so the walk + wait + bus is one Commute. A stop you moved
-- yourself, or one within 35 m of a place you named, is kept.

-- The phone's sync (same as 021, plus: a short wait somewhere you don't have a place isn't a stop).
